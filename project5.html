							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>This project was made as a board game played in final round of MTC LOGIKA UI 2022 in collaboration with LOGIKA's academic team
								especially Elbert Krison, the mastermind behind the game mechanics.
								Unlike my other projects, this is not a data related project, but mainly is a programming project in base python.
								Please visit my <a href = "#github">github repository</a> to view the code.
							</p>
							<h2>Objective</h2>
							<p>The project is to create a board game for five teams that will compete in MTC. The game consists of math problem solving part as well
								as board game thinking. This will pressure the teams to not only be good at math problems, but also strategize in order to take advantage
								of the board mechanics.
							</p>
							<p>The players goal is to collect coins from solving problems and visiting the board tiles.
								The game consists of a hexagonal board with 7 tiles, each with their unique services that the teams can use while inside.
								There are also items that can alter the game flow and disadvatege other team. 
								This game will be run for 14 rounds simulating 2 weeks journey, and the team with highest coins will win the competition. 
							</p>
							<h2>Method</h2>
							<p>The following will reference the v2, created after the actual competition.
								The programming based on modular programming philosophy, being every action that is happening is coded in a separate function
								that is called in the main program. There is a touch of object programming used for creating team player using python's class.
								This version is also improved with error handling to catch unintended user input.
