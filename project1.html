							<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>This project was made for the final round of STC LOGIKA UI 2023 in collaboration with Raden Fadil.
								Documents involved are written in Indonesia, and this article hopefully can provide context to it. 
								Please visit my <a href = "#github">github repository</a> to view the code.
							</p>
							<h2>Objective</h2>
							<p>The premise started with Yobank, a (fictional) digital bank that eager to expand their business into credit loan market. 
								In preparation, they have done a market research that grant loan to several customers and track their payment behaviour. 
								This information was coupled with each customer's background information such as property ownership, automobile ownership, family member count, 
								education status, and monthly income. The data were provided in two separate datasets.
								The objective is to evaluate whether an applicant are likely to default on their loan given their background information. 
								Such customers are labeled as bad customer, and the rest as good customer.
							</p>
							<h2>Method</h2>
							<p>We started with processing the data to better fit the fitting process.
								Those involved selecting features, transformation, binning, null values imputation, outlier detection,  labeling, and generating dummy features. 
								We notice that the data gives was highly imbalaced with the majority of customers belong to the good category. 
								In the process we need to account for this by making synthetic samples of the minority class.
							</p>
							<p>The classification algorithm used are Decision Tree Classifier.
								This decision comes after comparing several algorithms performace and concluding that Decision Tree was among the highest performance algorithms
								with especially fast run time. 
								The main performance metric used was F1 score as a middle ground of avoiding bad customers and reducing opportunity cost from excluding the good ones.
							</p>
							<p>The whole operation run on python with the preparation done in pandas and numpy package, with the machine learning done in pycaret. </p>
